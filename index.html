        <p class="pillars">Whether I should get involved in running the country at all. It's a very difficult political
          situation. But when the
          students called me up and explained what the situation is, finally I said, "Yes, you have given lives for this. If
          you
          can give lives, I can remove all my other considerations. I can be of your service. I'll do that."He added
          that,"People are in the mood for revolution. So this is a revolutionary situation. They were killed. So they are
          looking for
          people who made their colleagues die. So people were attacking the followers of the party headed by Sheikh Hasina.
          When
          you say minority community being attacked, that minority community, particularly Hindu community, was associated
          with
          her. So you cannot distinguish whether they were attacked because they're followers of Sheikh Hasina or they were
          attacked because they are Hindu. But they were attacked, that's for sure. But then we took over the government and
          tried
          to bring peace. I kept telling everybody that we may have differences of opinion. That doesn't mean we have to
          attack
          each other."</p>
